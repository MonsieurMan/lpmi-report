# Rapport de fin d'ann√©e de LPMI  
This repository contains my end report for my CS license graduate.

I built my self a small project around markdown-pdf to write it using markdown as I hate Word and all that kind of software.

## Instructions
```sh
git clone https://github.com/MonsieurMan/lpmi-report
yarn | npm i
yarn start | npm start
```
If you want to use the same setup, I recommend using [SumatraPDF](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html) when writing as it will reload the file on change.
